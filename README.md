# SharedVehicles
This is a project for simulating shared vehicle systems for urban transportation. 
Basic idea behind "SharedVehicles" (no space between) is to create simulation of urban transportation systems for building better transportation systems in real world. An important assumption is that no one type of vehicle or system can be effective in meeting different needs of millions of people of a big city. A modern city usually has multiple modes of transportation systems coupled with private vehicles. An intelligent system would make best use of vehicles and technologies, and people need not necessarily own the vehicles to enjoy fast and reliable transportation.
We believe electric vehicles are vehicles of the future, and we will make sure they will be.

Our initial simulations are basically Agent-Based Modeling, and you can learn about agent based modeling here -
